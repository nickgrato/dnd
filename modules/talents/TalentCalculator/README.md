## TalentCalculator

This component is the brains of the operation. It has an maintains the state of the talent calculator. It also orchestrates the larger component in the layout.

All events, more or less, pertaining to state change should be reported back to this parent component.

## Future Proofing

If I were to build this feature out further, I would add the ability to initiate the state with talents. Right now this only works as a clean slate.
